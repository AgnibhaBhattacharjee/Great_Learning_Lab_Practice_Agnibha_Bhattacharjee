This is a Hotel booking application.
I have created only 1 Hotel object. If you want to switch from no floor preferance to floor preferance mode, it is better to run the program again. which will create the Hotel object again.
Either if one room is occupied in first iteration it will be occupied only, if you want switch to floor preference mode.
